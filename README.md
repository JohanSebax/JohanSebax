### A little about me...  <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/VgCDAzcKvsR6OM0uWg/giphy.gif" width="50"> 

I'm a Mechanical Engineer currently taking a boot camp in Data Analyst. I'm a **Tech Enthusiast 💻 😃** passionate about learning and working with new tech. I love building interesting and amazing products that serve a great deal of purpose. <br/><br/>

In my learning and professional career I have worked in different areas in the BPO and business sector, I also know the financial area with banks since my different roles involve advising clients with transaction problems, cancellations, and blocking accounts with a variety of financial institutions. I have developed a personal project with Python to analyze customer transaction information and display all the information in a web application from a server mounted from Render or other web services. The project consisted of taking data on customer behavior from a web page in .csv format, then with that data making a study of the main relevant metrics that help find trends or patterns, Streamlit was used as a framework for data visualizations through
graphics and for a friendly interface for page visitors. I know different data visualization platforms such as Tableau, Power BI, PowerPoint, among others.

I like working as a team and sharing my knowledge with others. I am the type of person who, when I face a problem, gives my all to find a solution.
